I WOULD LIKE to try some initial experiments in the direction of the ideas in this "neural information geometry" paper, via trying to validate the basic use of information geometry to speed up PC learning in the context of classification of MNIST images, after the fashion of the "continuous learning on image classification" paper. Can you outline a simple initial version of the ActPC-Geom idea suitable for exploration in continuous learning for MNIST? This should involve neural approximation of Wasserstein metric, etc.

Reasoned about ActPC-Geom for MNIST classification for 14 seconds

Below is a suggested outline for a “proof-of-concept” version of the ActPC-Geom (Active Predictive Coding with Information-Geometric speedups) idea that you could prototype on MNIST in a continuous/online learning setup. The intention here is to keep the design simple but still highlight how one might incorporate a neural approximation of the Wasserstein metric (or another geometry-based metric) to accelerate predictive-coding-style updates. The outline is broken into the main components of the experiment: data stream setup, basic predictive-coding pipeline, geometry modeling (Wasserstein approximation), incremental/continuous learning loop, and evaluation.

---

## **1\. DATA AND CONTINUOUS LEARNING SETUP**

1. **Dataset & Stream Construction**

   * Start with MNIST (28×28 grayscale images, 10 classes).

   * Shuffle and organize the data into an **online stream** of images (e.g., one pass, or small mini-batches that get discarded once processed).

   * Optionally, create small “task” blocks (as in Split-MNIST style) to test catastrophic forgetting if that is also a goal—i.e., digit pairs (0,1)(0,1)(0,1), then (2,3)(2,3)(2,3), etc.

   * Convert the images into a format suitable for predictive coding:

     * If you prefer *rate-coded* inputs: simply feed normalized pixel values to a rate-coded layer or standard neural units.

     * If you prefer *spike-coded* inputs (following the “continuous learning on image classification” paper approach), use Poisson sampling to generate spike trains for each pixel and present them for a fixed duration.

2. **Incremental / Single-Pass Learning Protocol**

   * Emphasize that each image (or small batch) arrives in sequence; once an image is consumed, do not reuse it for additional epochs.

   * This protocol helps mimic a “live” data stream scenario and ensures you are indeed continuously updating the model.

---

## **2\. CORE PREDICTIVE CODING ARCHITECTURE**

1. **Basic Network Layout**

   * For simplicity, pick a small multi-layer predictive-coding (PC) network, e.g.:

     1. **Input layer** (dimension \= 784 if rate-coded, or spike-coded dimension if spiking)

     2. **One or two hidden layers** (e.g., 256 units each)

     3. **Classification head** (10 output units, or 10 spiking neurons, one per digit class)

   * Within each layer (or “stage”), maintain:

     1. Neuronal states s(ℓ)\\mathbf{s}^{(\\ell)}s(ℓ) (or v(ℓ)\\mathbf{v}^{(\\ell)}v(ℓ) if you use LIF-voltage variables in a spiking version)

     2. Error units e(ℓ)\\mathbf{e}^{(\\ell)}e(ℓ) that encode prediction mismatches

     3. Weights W(ℓ)\\mathbf{W}^{(\\ell)}W(ℓ) and possibly separate “error-weight” or “feedback” matrices E(ℓ)\\mathbf{E}^{(\\ell)}E(ℓ)

2. **Forward Inference & State Update**

   * At each time step (or each mini-batch):

     1. **Predict** top-down or lateral signals z^(ℓ−1)=W(ℓ) s(ℓ)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^{(\\ell-1)} \= \\mathbf{W}^{(\\ell)} \\,\\mathbf{s}^{(\\ell)}z^(ℓ−1)=W(ℓ)s(ℓ)

     2. **Compute error** e(ℓ−1)=s(ℓ−1)−z^(ℓ−1)\\mathbf{e}^{(\\ell-1)} \= \\mathbf{s}^{(\\ell-1)} \- \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}^{(\\ell-1)}e(ℓ−1)=s(ℓ−1)−z^(ℓ−1)

     3. **Update states** (like the standard iterative PC loop) either via gradient descent on local energy or via a spiking neural coding iteration (as in your continuous learning on image classification references).

3. **Synaptic/Weight Updates**

   * In the simplest PC approach, a local Hebbian-like or local representation-alignment (LRA) rule can be used, e.g.:  
      ΔW(ℓ)  ∝  e(ℓ−1) (s(ℓ)) ⁣⊤. \\Delta \\mathbf{W}^{(\\ell)} \\;\\propto\\; \\mathbf{e}^{(\\ell-1)} \\,\\bigl(\\mathbf{s}^{(\\ell)}\\bigr)^{\\\!\\top}.ΔW(ℓ)∝e(ℓ−1)(s(ℓ))⊤.  
   * Adapt the classification-layer weights in a similar local fashion, or combine with a small replay buffer of labeled examples (if you wish to mitigate forgetting).

4. **Loss / Cost Function**

   * If purely unsupervised for the hidden layers, the cost is the sum of squared errors (or spike mismatch) across the layers.

   * For classification, measure cross-entropy or mean-squared error at the output, so that the final error neurons in the classification layer push the hidden layers to form discriminative representations.

---

## **3\. INCORPORATING GEOMETRY: NEURAL WASSERSTEIN APPROXIMATION**

A key novelty for “ActPC-Geom” is to adapt predictive-coding updates in a way that respects the underlying manifold geometry of the neural representations or parameter space. A simple approach:

1. **Motivation**

   * Instead of (or in addition to) standard gradient-based PC updates in Euclidean space, we want to move the parameter vector θ\\boldsymbol{\\theta}θ (all weights) along directions that minimize the local Wasserstein (or other geometry-based) mismatch.

   * The idea is akin to doing a “natural gradient” step or a geometry-corrected step that accounts for how changing θ\\boldsymbol{\\theta}θ affects the distribution of neural activities.

2. **Neural Network to Approximate Wasserstein Metric**

   * Maintain a small auxiliary neural net gϕ(x,x′)g\_\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}')gϕ​(x,x′) that takes in pairs of data samples (x,x′)(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}')(x,x′) (or pairs of layerwise activities) and outputs an estimate of the squared Wasserstein-2 distance or some related cost.

   * Concretely:

     * Sample pairs of internal representations s(ℓ)(x)\\mathbf{s}^{(\\ell)}(\\mathbf{x})s(ℓ)(x), s(ℓ)(x′)\\mathbf{s}^{(\\ell)}(\\mathbf{x}')s(ℓ)(x′) at a layer ℓ\\ellℓ.

     * Train gϕg\_\\phigϕ​ in an online fashion to approximate the actual distance or some known cost function—e.g., you could treat ∥s(ℓ)(x)−s(ℓ)(x′)∥2\\|\\mathbf{s}^{(\\ell)}(\\mathbf{x}) \- \\mathbf{s}^{(\\ell)}(\\mathbf{x}')\\|^2∥s(ℓ)(x)−s(ℓ)(x′)∥2 as a simple placeholder, then gradually morph it toward a more refined measure that approximates the Wasserstein distance.

   * *Simplification*: Start with a simpler distance or correlation-based measure, then refine if time permits.

3. **Geometry-Corrected Update**

   * In principle, once you have an approximate local distance measure gϕg\_\\phigϕ​, you can “rescale” or re-weight the ordinary PC gradient with the local geometry. For example:  
      Δθ  ≈  F−1∇ ⁣θL, \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\;\\approx\\; \\mathbf{F}^{-1} \\nabla\_{\\\!\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L},Δθ≈F−1∇θ​L,  
      where F\\mathbf{F}F might be the approximate Fisher matrix or a matrix derived from the gϕg\_\\phigϕ​ function’s partial derivatives.

   * For a **very first prototype**, it may suffice to do something more heuristic:

     * Compute the standard PC update step.

     * Compute a “step-size modulation” factor from gϕg\_\\phigϕ​, e.g. if the local manifold measure indicates that two states are “very close,” use a smaller update to avoid stepping too far in parameter space.

4. **Implementation Tips**

   * Keep the geometry modeling “lightweight” at first—maybe a single-layer MLP for gϕg\_\\phigϕ​ or a known closed-form formula for a small batch of internal states.

   * Compare run-time or convergence with and without the geometry-corrected update.

---

## **4\. COMPLETE LEARNING LOOP**

Put everything together into an iterative or streaming loop:

1. **Initialization**

   * Randomly initialize PC network weights W(ℓ)\\mathbf{W}^{(\\ell)}W(ℓ), E(ℓ)\\mathbf{E}^{(\\ell)}E(ℓ), and the geometry net gϕg\_\\phigϕ​.

2. **For each incoming MNIST sample (or small mini-batch)**

   * **Forward PC Pass**: Predict, compute error units, iteratively settle neuronal states.

   * **Update Weights**:

     * Basic PC update for W(ℓ)\\mathbf{W}^{(\\ell)}W(ℓ).

     * If using geometry, incorporate the geometric factor (e.g., a re-scaling from your approximation net gϕg\_\\phigϕ​).

   * **Online Update of gϕg\_\\phigϕ​** (optional, if doing a data-driven geometry approximation):

     * Maintain a small queue of “recent” internal representations at layer ℓ\\ellℓ.

     * Sample pairs from that queue, do a quick gradient step to make gϕg\_\\phigϕ​ approximate the distribution metric or distance for those pairs.

   * **Move to Next Sample**: Discard or store for minimal replay (depending on your design).

3. **Stopping**

   * Continue until you have processed the entire MNIST stream (60,000 samples once each).

   * For continuous learning beyond MNIST, proceed to subsequent tasks or class subsets (e.g., Split-MNIST approach).

4. **Evaluation**

   * Maintain a *held-out test set* (or use the standard MNIST test set). Periodically measure classification accuracy to see how well the geometry-based approach influences performance.

   * For “continuous learning” or “catastrophic forgetting” experiments, measure performance after each subtask to see if the geometry-based update helps preserve old knowledge.

---

## **5\. EXPERIMENTAL VARIANTS AND ANALYSIS**

1. **Baseline Comparisons**

   * Compare “ActPC-Geom” to a vanilla predictive-coding classifier (no geometry).

   * Optionally compare to a backprop-based approach or a simple SNN approach (like df-BFA) to see if geometric corrections shorten training time or reduce forgetting.

2. **Metrics to Track**

   * **Classification Accuracy** over time (or over tasks).

   * **Catastrophic Forgetting** metrics (ACC, BWT) if doing multi-task splits.

   * **Convergence Speed** or “effective epochs” (how quickly the PC network’s internal states settle).

   * **Energy / Loss** or reconstruction mismatch in predictive-coding.

   * **Runtime** or iteration counts, to see if geometry gives a speedup in practice.

3. **Ablation Studies**

   * Try turning off the geometry net gϕg\_\\phigϕ​ (i.e., set that factor to 1.0, ignoring it) to confirm that any improvement is indeed from the geometric factor.

   * Evaluate how big the geometry net can be before overhead outweighs its gains.

   * Evaluate different ways of approximating the Wasserstein metric (e.g. simpler MMD or correlation metrics vs. more advanced neural approximations).

---

## **6\. PRACTICAL TIPS AND SIMPLIFICATIONS**

* **Start small**: E.g., single hidden layer, only a rough correlation-based measure in place of a full Wasserstein distance. Just demonstrate that the geometry-based rescaling can reduce the number of updates needed.

* **Minimize overhead**: The synergy between geometry and PC can be subtle. Initially, keep geometry net gϕg\_\\phigϕ​ very simple (e.g., one hidden layer with 16–32 units).

* **Gradual refinement**: Once you have a stable minimal system, refine the geometry approximation—e.g., an OT-based approach with a small bounding set of points from the representation space.

* **Implementation detail**: If you are using a spiking variant (like in your or Ororbia’s spiking PC approach), the geometry net can still be a standard MLP that receives time-averaged firing rates or trace-based features from the spiking layers.

---

### **Concluding Remarks**

This minimalist outline captures the essentials of *ActPC-Geom* on MNIST in a single-pass, continuous learning style, using a predictive-coding architecture and a lightweight geometry module (e.g., a neural approximation to the Wasserstein distance). While there are many ways to refine each piece—especially the geometry factor—this framework should let you explore whether geometric corrections help speed up or stabilize predictive coding in an online classification setting. You can then expand toward more complex networks, multi-task scenarios, or different geometry metrics (e.g. Fisher-like natural gradient approximations, learned transport maps, etc.).

Can you write detailed pseudocode for implementing all this using the NGC-Learn software toolkit from Alex Ororbia's lab?

Reasoned about ActPC-Geom pseudocode implementation for 1m 33s

Below is a detailed pseudocode example that shows one way to implement an “ActPC‐Geom” system for continual MNIST classification using the NGC‐Learn software toolkit (developed by Alex Ororbia’s lab). This pseudocode builds on a standard neural generative coding (NGC) architecture and integrates an auxiliary “geometry module” to approximate a Wasserstein‐like metric that rescales local predictive coding (PC) weight updates.

In this example the network is constructed as a multi–layer PC network with state units, prediction errors, and local Hebbian (LRA‐like) updates. After each forward inference iteration, the code computes local gradient updates and then “corrects” them using a geometry module (implemented here as a simple MLP) that outputs scaling factors from the current layer’s internal representation. The training loop is “streaming”—each MNIST sample is processed only once (or as mini–batches if desired).

**Note:** This pseudocode is written in a Python–like style. In practice, you would use the NGC-Learn API classes and methods (which provide support for building NGC networks, iterative state updates, and local synaptic updates). You may need to adapt the API calls to the exact toolkit version you are using. The pseudocode below is inspired by the design in \[​\] and related NGC-Learn implementations.

### **Explanation**

1. **GeometryModule:**  
    This class defines a simple two–layer MLP that takes the current layer’s representation and outputs a multiplicative factor. In practice, you might train this module to approximate a Wasserstein (or other geometry) metric.

2. **ActPCGeomNetwork:**  
    This class defines an NGC-style predictive coding network. It initializes standard feed–forward weights, maintains state and error arrays for each layer, and—for each layer (except the input)—includes a corresponding GeometryModule (if geometry is enabled). The core functions are:

   * `encode_input`: Prepares the MNIST sample.

   * `forward_inference`: Iteratively refines each layer’s state using prediction error.

   * `compute_pc_gradients` and `update_weights`: Compute and then apply local, Hebbian-style weight updates.  
      The updates are “corrected” by multiplying each weight–update by a factor produced by the geometry module for that layer.

3. **Training Loop (`train_actpc_geom`):**  
    This loop simulates streaming through MNIST. It processes each sample exactly once, updates the network states and weights, and also (optionally) updates the parameters of the geometry modules. Periodic evaluation on a separate test set is shown.

4. **Utility functions:**  
    Functions for preprocessing the MNIST images, obtaining a data stream, computing target geometry factors (to encourage, for example, a certain average activation), and evaluating the network are provided.

You can integrate this pseudocode into the NGC-Learn toolkit framework by mapping these routines onto its API calls and data structures. This design gives you a starting point for exploring the use of information–geometric corrections (via a neural approximation of the Wasserstein metric) to accelerate online predictive coding for image classification and continual learning.

Feel free to adapt, extend, or modify this pseudocode as needed for your experiments with ActPC-Geom.

Below is an outline of what you can expect in terms of experiment size and throughput on a modern multi‐GPU server—with a few caveats that much depends on the specific implementation details and how much of the computation is offloaded to GPUs.

---

### **Typical Computational Load for MNIST Experiments**

1. **Dataset and Model Size:**

   * MNIST is very small by today’s standards (60,000 training and 10,000 testing images, each 28×28).

   * The proposed predictive coding network (e.g., a 784–256–256–10 architecture) is modest in size compared to modern deep networks.

2. **Iterative Inference:**

   * Your design involves iterative inference (e.g., 10 iterations per sample) and local Hebbian-style weight updates—this generally adds computational overhead relative to a single forward-backprop pass.

   * However, because each update involves relatively small matrix multiplications, using a GPU (especially across multiple GPUs) can efficiently handle these operations.

3. **Multi-GPU Throughput:**

   * On a modern multi-GPU server (say with 4–8 NVIDIA RTX 30-series or A6000-class GPUs), a single MNIST training run (one pass through the training set using the online/streaming protocol) will likely take on the order of minutes per configuration if the code is reasonably optimized.

   * In many cases, even if your implementation is not highly “fancy” (for example, if you’re using the NGC-Learn toolkit’s standard routines for matrix multiplications and state updates), each experiment remains computationally lightweight.

---

### **What Experiment Scale Is Feasible?**

* **Single-Configuration Runs:**

  * Expect one full pass over MNIST (60000 samples) to be completed in a few minutes per run on a single GPU core, depending on the exact number of iterative inference steps.

  * Even if you run a full continual learning experiment (e.g., a split-MNIST setup with five tasks), the extra overhead is minor compared to data sizes in large-scale deep learning—these experiments can also run in minutes to tens of minutes.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning and Repeats:**

  * You could easily run dozens (or even low hundreds) of independent experiments (for different hyperparameter configurations, random seeds, or architecture variants) in parallel.

  * For example, if each experiment takes about 5 minutes, running 50–100 experiments concurrently across multiple GPUs is quite feasible.

  * In a multi-GPU setup, you can allocate one experiment per GPU (or even split a single experiment over multiple GPUs if your toolkit supports data parallelism), which means that the entire hyperparameter search or ablation study might be completed within a day.

* **Scaling Up:**

  * With minimal code modifications (i.e., without doing “anything too fancy”), you can experiment with small-scale continual learning setups (like split-MNIST) and even consider moving to slightly larger datasets (like Fashion MNIST) or deeper networks.

  * Since MNIST-based experiments are not memory intensive, you can run multiple experiments concurrently without saturating the GPU memory.

---

### **Practical Suggestions**

* **Baseline and Ablation Studies:**

  * For a baseline ActPC-Geom experiment versus a vanilla predictive coding model (or even a standard SNN baseline like df-BFA), each run on MNIST should be very light. A complete set of ablations (e.g., testing with geometry correction ON and OFF across 10 seeds each) should be executable in a few hours on a modern multi-GPU server.

* **Using NGC-Learn:**

  * Because the NGC-Learn toolkit is built to efficiently simulate neural generative coding models, and it likely leverages GPU-accelerated operations for its core matrix computations, you can expect good scaling without having to optimize at the CUDA level.

  * In many cases, you could run mini–batches (if desired) which can further boost throughput if you decide to treat the online stream in small parallel batches.

* **Resource Allocation:**

  * If your server has four GPUs and each MNIST experiment requires only a fraction of one GPU’s resources, you may be able to run 4–8 experiments concurrently without interference.

  * The lightweight nature of these experiments means that extensive hyperparameter sweeps across many configurations (and even doing multiple random seed repeats) is entirely within reach on a single multi-GPU server.

---

### **Conclusion**

On a modern multi-GPU server, you should comfortably be able to run:

* **Single-run experiments:** Training one instance (60000 samples, 10 inference iterations per sample) in approximately 5–10 minutes per configuration.

* **Concurrent experiments:** Dozens (e.g., 20–100) of MNIST experiments—whether as baselines, ablation studies, or hyperparameter tuning—using data–parallel or process–parallel execution.

* **Scaling to continual learning setups:** With models like split-MNIST, the additional computational load is only marginally higher; the full suite of online continual learning experiments might still complete within a few hours.

In short, without doing any particularly fancy or low-level optimizations, your proposed experiments are well within the reach of a single modern multi-GPU server, letting you rapidly prototype and evaluate multiple configurations and variants of the ActPC-Geom approach.

Feel free to adjust batch sizes, number of inference iterations, or network depth as needed; the key takeaway is that for MNIST-scale data and moderate network sizes, the computational cost is quite manageable on modern hardware.
