- not just a single, massively loaded up (with GPUs and CPUs) beefy machine, but a number of them
- migrate one or more of the network nodes (each with widely varying specs [1] (this is actually a desired testbed setup, rather than trying to create identical hardware (good to blend OS variants too!))) to remote location(s) 
- expand out with testing, using different machines in different physical locations, running different OSes, connected via wildly different network uplinks (satellite, symmetric and asymmetric high bandwidth fiber, lower bandwidth options, etc...) in order to try to figure out how best to distribute the calculation(s), processing, etc...


[1] relevant details:
- how much RAM
- # of CPU Cores
- Processor speed
- # of GPUs (if any)
